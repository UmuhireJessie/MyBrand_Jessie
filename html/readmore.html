                            <p class="blogdesc">Let us start by defining what cache memory is, cache memory is more of a
                                random access memory.
                                Its main advantage is that it can be accessed much more quickly as compared to the speed
                                by which </p> <br>

                                the main memory can be accessed. The cache is located between the CPU and the main
                                memory, and it
                                matches the speed of the processor, hence maintaining the high speed of data transfer
                                between the two.
                                Having the cache memory we have to understand how reaches there or is moved from it to
                                the main memory 
                                and how it is taken to the processor. There are a number of techniques by which this
                                happens but I am going
                                to discuss two of them.Direct mapping and fully associative mapping I am going to do a
